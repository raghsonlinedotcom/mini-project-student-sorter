# mini-project-student-sorter
A complete Core Java based mini project tha reads the student details from a file and writes the details in an ascending order based on their ranking into a different file.

Write a Java Application that consumes the inputs from a text file (⁠ input.txt ⁠) that has the list of Student details, and processes the details to arrange the Students based on their ranking and stores the output into a separate file (⁠ output.txt ⁠). The complete project should be done on Core Java and NO other external libraries. 

# Topics

## Bare Minimum 
- Java SE essentials (compiling, executing a Java Program)
- JDK, JRE, JVM 
- Data types
   * Built in (Primitives, String, Array)
   * Custom (User defined - Student, Employee etc.,)
   * String, StringBuffer, StringBuffer
- Conditionals (if, else)
- Branching, Decision Making (switch, break)
- Iteraions (for, while, do-while)
- OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
- Classes and Objects
- Interfaces - a gentle intro
- OOP Characteristics
   * Abstraction
   * Encapsulation
   * Inheritance
   * Polymorphism
- Java's Super object `java.lang.Object`
- Java's built-in packages
   * `java.lang`
   * `java.util`
   * `java.io`
- Exception Handling
   * Java's Exception Hierarchy - `Throwable`, 
- Collections - a gentle Intro
   * List (Vs Arrays)
   * Map
   * Set
- Overview of System and Utility Classes
  * `java.lang.Sysem` [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html]
  * `java.util.Arrays` [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html]
  * `java.util.Objects` [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html]
  * Comparator Interface `java.util.Comparator` [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html]
- Input Output (I/O)
   * Basics
   * Java IO hierarchy
   * Stream Vs Character based
   * Efficient processing of data using Buffers
   * Reading data from a file
   * Write data to a file 
- Popular File Types
  * ASCII Text (`input.txt`)
  * CSV (Comma Separated Values) (`input.csv`)
  * JSON (Javascript Object Notation) (`input.json`) - NOT in detail, just a gentle intro
  * XML (Extended Markup Language) - NOT in detail, just a gentle intro
  * Excel (MS Excel) - NOT in detail, just a gentle intro
- Processing the data from different file types
  * Use your own Reader
  * Alternate: use the dedicated libraries (Open Source) for an easy and efficient alternate 

# Project 

* Scope - Understand the scope of the project
* Input - Read the input data from the file (`input.txt`, `input.csv`)
    - Read the raw data
    - Process them and convert into Java Objects
    - Handle Exceptions gracefully
* Processing - Sorting the details
* Output - write the data into `output.txt`, `output.csv`
* Give a meaningful message to the User

- Custom Packages
- Abstract Classes
- Interfaces
- Java 8 features
   * Lambdas
   * Streams
   * Functional Interfaces
   * Optionals
   * Default Methods
